    info:'Gulab Jamus is known as one of the most popular Indian dessert, isn’t it? But the fact is, it’s not an Indian dessert. Aren’t you curious to know where did Gulab Jamum come from? Well, you will be surprised to know that Gulab Jamun came to India from Persia or modern day Iran with our Muslim sultans and badshahs. The Indian gulab jamun dish originated from an Arabic dessert called Luqmat Al-Qadi and became popular during the Mughal era. The later name, gulab, actually comes from the two Persian words gul (flower) and ab (water). Gulab Jamun, as the history goes was first prepared in medieval India derived from Persian invaders.'

    img:"./img/ricethali.jpg",
    info:'Thali refers to the metal plate that a thali meal may be served on. Thali is popular in Punjab[2] , Uttar Pradesh and other states in North India. The idea behind a thali is to offer all the 6 different flavours of sweet, salt, bitter, sour, astringent and spicy on one single plate (technically the last two are actually forms of chemesthesis rather than true flavours). According to Indian food custom, a proper meal should be a perfect balance of all these six flavours. Restaurants typically offer a choice of vegetarian or meat-based thalis. Vegetarian thalis are very typical and commonplace in Tamil Nadu canteens (and South India and Southeast Asia in general), and are a popular lunch choice.'
